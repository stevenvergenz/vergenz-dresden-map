Dresdenville Campaigns in DOT language
=========================================

This is an attempt to clean up the horrendous mess inevitably created by my Dresdenville-style character/city creation processes. Uses the DOT graph language and GraphViz rendering software to describe relationships. For more information on these pieces of software, please see [the documentation](http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php).

Guys, feel free to chip in on the transcription, I have a feeling it will take a while.
